# **NodeVault**

### **Project Overview**
NodeVault is a decentralized image-sharing platform that uses IPFS and the Pinata API to securely upload, store, and manage images in a privacy-preserving and immutable way.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Secure Image Upload**: Supports PNG, JPG, and JPEG file formats.
- **IPFS Integration**: Pins images to IPFS for decentralized storage.
- **Image Previews**: Displays uploaded images with thumbnails.
- **File Metadata**: Shows file size, IPFS hash, and timestamp.
- **Persistent Access**: Images remain accessible through IPFS gateway links.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Pinata API, IPFS
- **Image Processing**: PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- **API Security**: Python Dotenv for managing environment variables

---

## **Security & Privacy**
- **Decentralized Storage**: Images are securely stored on IPFS.
- **API Key Security**: API keys are stored using environment variables to ensure privacy.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- **User Authentication**: Implement user login and access control.
- **Metadata Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive metadata.
- **Bulk Uploads**: Add functionality for bulk image uploads.
- **Generative AI**: Use AI to enhance user experience with features like auto-tagging, image categorization, and personalized recommendations.
